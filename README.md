## Insights

For public sentiment distribution, this suggests a generally unfavorable public opinion in this dataset. As there is a slight high number of unfavourable sentiment from the citizens over the new fare system.

Keyword Categories Frequency highlights which keyword categories appear most often. "Uncategorized" has the highest frequency, followed by "complaint" and "pricing."
